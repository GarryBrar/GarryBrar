### Hey there! 🫡

I'm Garry, a software engineer based in Canada. 

Unfortunately, I'm currently obsessed with trying to build everything that pops into my head...

My main tech stack is Python, C++, and AWS, but I've done a bit of everything - from low-level systems to experimenting with new AI stacks.

This is a fresh profile where I'll be uploading a collection of random things, smaller projects, and experiments. 

**Currently Working On**:
- Deep Learning & Recommendation Systems.
- Familiarizing with AWS Bedrock, S3, and Lambda.
- Delphi - App coming soon!
- Brover - A cognitive ETL device built on Raspberry Pi, coming soon!

Feel free to reach out!
